# 10c Time Bot

A systematic, multi-sleeve trading bot for index futures, futures baskets,
and crypto perpetuals. Built around three of the best-documented
retail-accessible edges in derivatives markets.

## Strategy (original design + iteration)

| Sleeve | Edge | Instrument | Audit status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A - Opening Range Breakout | Intraday momentum on NY open | MNQ / liquid ETFs | Incomplete (needs longer 5-min data) |
| B - Time-Series Momentum   | 12-month trend on multi-asset basket | ~10 liquid ETFs | **Deployable** - all 7 robustness checks pass |
| C - Crypto Cash-and-Carry  | Funding-rate arbitrage | BTC/ETH spot vs perp | **Shelved** - failed walk-forward |
| D - Cross-Sectional Momentum | Sector ETF rotation | 9 SPDR sectors | **Shelved** - no real edge (signal weaker than equal-weight) |

Each sleeve has published out-of-sample evidence in the academic
literature. Robustness auditing in this repo is what determines whether
that evidence reproduces on our specific implementation and data window.
See **Status** below for current results.

## Evidence

- **ORB**: Zarattini & Aziz, *Can Day Trading Really Be Profitable?* (SSRN, 2023)
- **TSMOM**: Hurst, Ooi & Pedersen, *A Century of Evidence on Trend-Following* (AQR, 2017);
  Moskowitz, Ooi & Pedersen, *Time Series Momentum* (JFE, 2012)
- **Cash-and-carry**: Standard derivatives arbitrage; basis = perp - spot,
  capture funding when basis > execution cost

## Target profile (Sleeve B only, currently the only deployable sleeve)

At default config (10% vol per position, 19-year backtest, net of 10bps
per rebalance):

- Net Sharpe: 0.71
- CAGR: 4.06% (scales roughly linearly with leverage on a vol-targeted
  strategy; 2x leverage -> ~8% CAGR with ~13% vol)
- Max drawdown: -14.3%
- Expect multi-year flat stretches (e.g. 2015-2019 was Sharpe ~0)

The original 3-sleeve target (Sharpe 1.0-1.4) assumed all sleeves working
uncorrelated. With only Sleeve B deployable today, combined-portfolio
targets are deferred until a second sleeve clears its audit.

## What's not in this bot

- Novel cycle theories without statistical backing
- Discretionary overrides
- Indicators whose alpha source is unspecified
- Anything that can't be backtested

## Risk rules (hard-coded)

- 1% risk per trade
- 2% daily loss cap - flatten and stop
- No-trade window for high-impact macro events (FOMC, CPI, NFP +/- 30 min)
- Sleeve kill-switch on 30-day rolling Sharpe < 0.3

## Status

Phase 1 - validation. Three sleeves implemented, two audited, one passes.

### Sleeve B - TSMOM (deployable)

10-ETF basket (SPY/QQQ/IWM/EFA/EEM/TLT/IEF/GLD/USO/DBC), 2007-2026,
229 months, net of 10bps round-trip:

- Sharpe 0.71, CAGR 4.06% (at 10% vol/position), MaxDD -14.3%
- Monthly win rate 57%
- Consistent with AQR Hurst/Ooi/Pedersen 2017; Moskowitz-Ooi-Pedersen 2012

Robustness audit (`scripts/audit_tsmom.py`) - all seven sections pass:

1. Baseline (reproducibility)              OK   Sharpe 0.72
2. Walk-forward train/test split           OK   0.82 -> 0.62 (delta 0.21)
3. Parameter grid (63 configs)             OK   100% positive, mean 0.57
4. Sub-period analysis (9x 4y windows)     OK   9/9 positive
5. Leave-one-out asset drop                OK   max delta 0.12 (QQQ)
6. Transaction-cost sensitivity            OK   breakeven at 200bps
7. Randomized-signal placebo (100 seeds)   OK   real 0.72 vs placebo -0.26, p<0.001

### Sleeve C - Crypto basis (shelved)

Initial unaudited backtest looked great: BTC+ETH equal-weight, 2020-2026
(6.4 years of Deribit funding history), portfolio Sharpe 1.29, BTC
standalone 2.07. Robustness audit (`scripts/audit_basis.py`) showed
the result is entirely a 2020-2021 bull-market funding-spike artifact:

  Walk-forward BTC:  train (2020-2023) 4.01 -> test (2023-2026) -0.65
  Walk-forward ETH:  train (2020-2023) 2.10 -> test (2023-2026) -2.81

  Annual Sharpe (BTC / ETH):
    2020  +7.9 / +5.0     (early bull)
    2021  +11.5 / +9.1    (peak funding ~1.5 bps/8h)
    2022  -11.8 / -13.5   (LUNA/FTX, funding flipped negative)
    2023  +0.7 / +3.8
    2024  +5.8 / +2.3
    2025  -3.5 / -11.4    (funding mean ~0.5 bps/8h, costs dominate)
    2026  -15.3 / -15.2   (partial year, bleeding)

The strategy can't pay its own transaction costs when funding mean
drops below ~1 bps per 8 hours. Do not deploy as-is. May be revisited
with a regime filter (e.g. only trade when 30-day mean funding >
threshold), but that's parameter-tuning to past data unless validated
out-of-sample on fresh data.

### Sleeve D - Cross-sectional sector momentum (shelved)

Attempted as an additional sleeve uncorrelated with B. Universe: 9 SPDR
sector ETFs (XLB, XLE, XLF, XLI, XLK, XLP, XLU, XLV, XLY), 1998-2026
(331 months). Long top-3 by trailing 12-month return, short bottom-3.

Audit (`scripts/audit_xsmom.py`) finds no real edge:

- Baseline Sharpe -0.06 over 28 years (MaxDD -54.5%)
- 84-config grid: only 21% positive, 0% above Sharpe 0.3
- Cost sensitivity: Sharpe is only +0.015 even at zero cost - the
  signal itself carries essentially no edge before transaction costs
- Placebo (random ranks): p-value 0.11, not significant
- Long-only variant: equal-weight benchmark across all 9 sectors has
  Sharpe 0.67; best long-only momentum variant has Sharpe 0.60. The
  momentum selection subtracts edge vs holding the basket equally.

Lesson: the cross-sectional momentum literature (Jegadeesh-Titman 1993,
Asness-Moskowitz-Pedersen 2013) is about **individual stocks** ranked
across hundreds of names. Sector-level aggregates are too coarse for
the same effect to survive - consistent with Moskowitz-Grinblatt 1999
findings that industry momentum is much weaker than stock momentum.

A more ambitious version would rank individual stocks (e.g. S&P 500
constituents). Operationally heavier and out of scope for v1.

### Sleeve A - ORB (incomplete)

Validated against QQQ + 7-ETF basket over ~60 days (the only window
with free 5-min intraday data via yfinance). Portfolio Sharpe near
zero on that sample. Longer 5-min history (Polygon, Databento, or
a broker export) is required before iterating on filters; otherwise
filter selection is overfitting to a 60-day noise window.
